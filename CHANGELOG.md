# Changelog

## 0.9.3 - proposed

- Remove the partial-report tile notice; retain unknown individual status and discreet coverage provenance.
- Describe missing team coverage as missing from this feed, without implying no official report exists.
- Add a collapsed, lazy player-details section for supported roster bio and current-season weekly injury records; preserve source body-part text and reported teams.
- Label practice undated and omit empty optional sections and unavailable production placeholders.
- Preserve LP/DNP badges, game-designation precedence, existing 2025 production/team history and keyboard/touch dismissal.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-10-08

- Show top-right LP/DNP practice badges and include those defenders in Uncertain;
  preserve game OUT/D/Q precedence and exclude game Out from Uncertain.
- Use neutral markers for missing status with one compact team coverage notice.
- Replace long defender popups with compact status and season-labelled stats;
  keep source links and timestamps in an accessible expandable section.
- Record the October 8 source, join, collection and deployment diagnosis.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-10-06

- Name individual field markers and preserve full accessible identities.
- Use published defensive depth positions, retain multiple assignments, and
  keep ambiguous coarse roles conservative.
- Summarize missing exact-match injury coverage once per matchup; retain
  individual uncertainty and never carry older Out reports into a new week.
- Extend desktop/mobile, source mapping and week-rollover regression coverage.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-10-06

- Replace long roster-first tiles with a schematic field of individual real
  defender Xs and an integrated All / Out / Uncertain depth panel.
- Preserve coarse source roles, all backups/reserves and unknown statuses;
  infer neither eleven starters nor individual assignments or quality scores.
- Add hover/focus previews, pinned tap details and reliable dismissal.
- Keep compact identities, mobile stacking and separate freshness evidence;
  move historical production into details.
- Add Chromium desktop/mobile browser regression coverage to source CI.

## Unreleased

- Rename the project from optasy to sideline. Player selections saved
  under the previous name are still read.

## 0.8.0 - prepared locally, unpublished

- Add separately labelled 2025 defensive-event history, historical teams,
  specific production leaders, role relevance and conditional absence context.
  Keep missing coverage, participation and quality/benefit limits explicit.
- Show injury-file age separately from unknown report time. Add manual shared
  data refresh, visible outcomes, failure backoff and deferred updates that
  preserve active interactions, selections and scroll.
- Label elapsed kickoff as status unconfirmed; never infer live/final from
  scores or a clock. Refresh stale depth context safely as retained data ages.
- Keep historical collection optional, resolve coarse linebacker event context
  conservatively, and clear deferred clock state on Escape or week changes.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-14

- Keep defender position beside the name as permanent identity text.
- Move depth levels, reserves, inactive players, practice squad and unknown
  context into section headings and subtle dividers.
- Show only relevant injury and availability pills; remove routine active,
  depth and reserve row badges while preserving uncertainty and full details.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-14

- Open details only on click, tap or explicit keyboard activation. Preserve
  focus navigation, Escape and outside-click dismissal.
- Group first-string defenders above other defenders using current depth
  evidence, preserving injury status and unknown-depth distinctions.
- Standardize row heights and equal position/injury/status pills, with names
  on the left and depth on the right. Keep narrow tiles readable with scrolling.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-13

- Show every available opponent defender, including reserves and practice
  squad, with status-colored borders and text labels. Exclude offense and
  special teams from the tiles while preserving source report records.
- Add reviewed daily depth-chart observations for first-string context; injury
  status overrides depth colors, and missing reports never imply health.
- Complete all 32 team logos with documented small editorial thumbnails,
  preserving separate image copyright and source records.
- Keep full explanations and the color legend in accessible popups; version
  browser module URLs so cached earlier code cannot break the new feed.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-13

- Replace explanatory page copy with a compact top search/week/information
  toolbar and a full board of equal vertical player tiles, starting with two
  spaces and narrowing to six; keep horizontal scrolling on small screens.
- Keep complete opponent injury rows concise. Move full designations, notes,
  availability limits and role context into hover/focus/tap popups.
- Move source, timestamp, privacy and licensing detail behind information
  buttons while preserving compact missing-data, game and failure states.
- Add twelve individually reviewed local team logos with recorded provenance
  and checksums; retain team-abbreviation fallbacks and omit player portraits.
  Keep the existing shared data collection and zero-cost deployment unchanged.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-13

- Replace manual snapshots with NFL player search, six removable selections,
  automatic weekly opponents and complete available team injury entries.
- Keep injured/reserve roster members searchable and distinguish game/practice
  status, missing coverage, unknown report vintage and plausible role relevance.
- Add reviewed CC BY 4.0 nflverse-data integration with shared hourly collection,
  bounded requests and retained previous deployment on failure. Upstream injuries
  update daily; no live or fantasy-effect claim is made.
- Preserve historical Python code/research; remove league and broader fantasy
  features from current product direction. Add offline parser/join/failure tests.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-10

- Transfer the canonical public repository to `snowball-projects/optasy` and
  retire the duplicate private GitHub companion after preservation and approval.
- Record that the draft passed without useful Optasy assistance; focus active
  development on opposing defensive injuries for weekly lineup decisions.
- Add a static dashboard with fictional examples, candidate comparisons,
  manual injury entry and validated local JSON import/download. Flag unknown
  coverage and older reports; exclude post-kickoff evidence. No automatic live
  feed, fantasy-point adjustment or start/sit ranking is claimed.
- Add a project icon, ten dashboard checks and GitHub Pages deployment. Preserve
  the existing Python implementation, tests and frozen research artifacts.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-07

- License original software and associated documentation under MIT and update
  current documentation and source identifiers. Retain third-party data
  attribution and the original licensing records of prior releases.
- Header-only changes alter source hashes; preserve existing freezes and use
  the documented amendment workflow before establishing a new prospective baseline.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-06

Initial source release of the existing decision and research scripts, with a
reviewed development baseline and explicit operating limits.

- Share agent guidance through `AGENTS.md` and a `CLAUDE.md` import.
- Refuse redirects on authenticated provider requests so credentials stay at
  the intended endpoint.
- Select the newest eligible injury report by its timestamp instant, including
  when reports use different timezone offsets.
- Reject historical-source and frozen-prediction manifest paths that leave
  their snapshot directory, including external symlinks.
- Raise dependency floors to the verified current releases and pin CI actions.
- Publish complete decision archives atomically and reject incomplete existing
  packages so interrupted writes cannot masquerade as preserved decisions.
- Add five synthetic integrity regression tests; the full suite has 44 tests.

This release does not refresh provider inputs, rewrite frozen research artifacts,
change recommendation policy, or enable a live draft integration. Code changes
invalidate existing source freezes by design; preserve earlier freezes and use
the documented amendment workflow when a new prospective baseline is approved.
